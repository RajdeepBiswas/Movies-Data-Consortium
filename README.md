# Movies-Data-Consortium
The Movies dataset is extraordinarily rich in nature and a lot of interesting data science and exploratory data analytics analysis can be done using it. In this project I have created a movies data consortium by blending a file data store sourced from the Movies Dataset hosted in Kaggle, website data from Wikipedia and API data from themoviedb.org.
